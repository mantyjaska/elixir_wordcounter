# WordFrequency

## Just a test to find out how to use Elixir

Used word frequency count as example application. Probably not the best way of doing what was done here. This is just a small project for my personal betterment.

In my local example used Kalevala as txt file from Gutenberg project, located in "util" directory.

**TODO:**

- add tests
- rewrite everything after reading how it should have been done
